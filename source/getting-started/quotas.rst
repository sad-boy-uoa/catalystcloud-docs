Quotas
######

The Catalyst Cloud provides customers with a quota mechanism to protect them
from accidentally launching too many resources. This helps prevent unexpected
and significant costs being invoiced to our customers. In fact, every cloud
provider has a similar mechanism, but most do not furnish this information to
their customers.

We allow customers to see their current per region quota on the overview page
of the dashboard. Quotas are a soft cap that can be changed at any time
according to your needs. A quota change may be requested via the support
panel: https://dashboard.cloud.catalyst.net.nz/management/tickets/

Catalyst may give you a call if you are about to exceed your quota and ask you
whether you would like us to pro-actively increase the quota for you.
