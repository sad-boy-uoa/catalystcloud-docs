What is a project?
##################

Openstack provides an isolated and multi-tenanted approach to creating user
workspaces. These workspaces are typically referred to as ``projects`` but
for historical reasons you may also see them referred to as ``tenants`` or
``tenancies``.

When you sign up to the Catalyst Cloud a ``project`` is created for you.
This process creates you a workspace within the cloud that is isolated,
by default, from every other project. It comes with an initial ``quota``
that sets a limit on the amount of cloud resources that you can initially
consume. This can be expanded if you need more resources.

The person who raised the cloud sign-up request gets added as the default
``Project Administrator`` and as such has the ability to invite and remove
users as they desire via the Access Control page under the Management tab
in the dashboard.

Your project has two important values associated with it:
the ``project name`` and the ``project id``. The project name is typically
a company name or an individual's name (as applicable).
The project key is an auto-generated unique 33 character string.

To find out how to view your project details refer to: :ref:`project-id-name`.

While projects are inherently secure, it is considered better to use
multiple projects where it's feasible to do so. For example, it is sensible
and useful to separate production workloads from development and testing
environments, if only to help mitigate the possibility of human error
impacting your business.
